# DEd

A keyboard-driven ***D***irectory ***Ed***itor.

This project may be inspired by dired, but it is my heavily opinionated take on a keyboard-driven file explorer.
It is not a dired "clone" or reimplementation and does not aim to be one.

Currently, DEd is not available through the VS Code marketplace, so you will need to clone the repository and build it yourself.

## Usage

Open via the command palette: **Open DEd**

## Build

As expected, this project requires npm:

```sh
npm install
npm run package
```
